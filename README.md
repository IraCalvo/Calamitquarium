Calamitquarium is an aquarium game intended to be a fanmade spiritual successor to the early 2000s game Insaniquarium, with an emphasis on a heightened level of difficulty compared to its predecessor. Developed during a rapid mini-game jam, the groundwork for Calamitquarium was created within two days.

Outside of minor balance changes, Calamitquarium mirrors the same mechanics as the original game. Although the game is still in its early stages and only features two levels, I intend to expand and improve on this project throughout 2024!

Key features of Calamitquarium include:

Animations
Sound effects (SFX)
Units with random movement patterns
Collision-based programming for added realism
Clicker-based gameplay
