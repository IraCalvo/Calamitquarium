This Calamitquarium! V1.0.0 ALPHA! This is meant to be game inspired my the old school popular game Insanqiuarium. Calamitquarium was made to be much more difficult than that of regular insaniquarium. Calamitquarium was made in a mini game jam type of deal. Where Iw as able to pump this the base of this game out within two days! As of right now there are no current mechanics that totally changes it from regular insaniquarium except for a few balance changes and such. Due to how new the game is as of right now there are currently only two levels but I plan to expand on this game much further and I have many plans for it!

the features this game provides is:
- Animations
- SFX
- Units random movement
- Collision based programming
- Clicker based gameplay
